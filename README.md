## Design

### Colour Scheme
![The colour palette](docs/features//palette.png)

Two of the colours (#c92324 and #ea861a) used were chosen using a color picker from the background image(see the Imagery section below). Then a [colour palette generator](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/) was used to choose complimentary colours (#084208 and #f4f7f9). [The contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) showed that the contrast between the navbar background and text is good (ratio 10.88:1). However, the contrast ratio was too low for the colors used for the main paragraphs (#ea861a for the background and #084208 for the text). Thus, to improve accessibility, a lighter color (#f2d363) was choosen for the background, bringing the contrast ratio score to 7.96:1.


### Typography

The fonts used for the website are imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
The font chosen for the logo as well as all the headings is Viga. It is described as having a good performance on the screen as well as a great personality.

![A font sample](docs/features/fontviga.png)

A [font pairing website](http://www.ourownthing.co.uk/fontpairing/) was then used to pick Anek Bangla, the font used for all the other text, such as paragraphs and buttons.

![A font sample](docs/features/fontanek.png)

### Imagery

The image main image, used for the background, was chosen due to its vibrant colours and the fruit looking like its bursting with flavour and vitamins. It is supposed to be associated with concepts such as freshness, nutrition, health and wellness.

![Menu carousel on deskop](docs/features/menupagecarousel.jpg)
![Menu carousel on mobile](docs/features/menupagecarouselmobile.png)

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

##  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
